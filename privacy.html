            “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
            and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more

          </li>
          <li>
            “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
            including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
            referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

        <h4 class="o-text-medium">SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
